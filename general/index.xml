      <title>My Motivation for This Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Again, this is NOT a blog about tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;-why&#34;&gt;‚ùì Why&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a researcher who has been involved in various projects and experiments, I have come across numerous instances of incorrect practices being used with common research tools. This incorrect usage has led to flawed results and wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I too have made some mistakes along the way. However, through my journey, I have learned valuable lessons that have greatly improved my understanding of these tools and their proper usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am eager to share my experiences, insights, and best practices, as if I hoped that there were someone did the same for me when I was a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;-the-importance&#34;&gt;‚ö†Ô∏è The Importance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to emphasize the importance of best practices in research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, inappropriate practices can affect other users becuase they often lead to abuse of shared resources. In the end, it makes the workflow inefficient for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As researchers, we strive to make meaningful contributions to our domains. Employing the right practices with research tools plays a pivotal role in achieving that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;-bridging-the-gap&#34;&gt;üèóÔ∏è Bridging the Gap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a newcomer to the world of research tools, I often found it challenging to locate comprehensive, easy-to-understand resources. Existing documentation can be dense, technical, and difficult to grasp, especially for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim in running this blog is to bridge that knowledge gap and provide fellow researchers, particularly newcomers, with practical insights and tips to effectively utilize these tools. I want to make the learning curve less steep for others than it was for me.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don‚Äôt have one yet, please obtain one by following step 1 and step 2 in this page.\n‚öôÔ∏è Network configurations Now that you should have an HPC account, we need to configure your network settings to access the HPC cluster.\nIf you are on the NYU network, you can access the HPC cluster directly without any extra configurations.\nOtherwise, you have two options to access the HPC cluster:\nNYU VPN: You can use the NYU VPN to connect to the NYU network. This is often default option for most users. HPC gateway: If in some cases you cannot use the NYU VPN, you can use the HPC gateway gw.hpc.nyu.edu (example below) to connect. Note that it is only a portal-like server, and you cannot run any jobs on it. Ôºû Command line 1. Gateway (Ignore this step if you are using NYU VPN or on the NYU network)\nConnect to the HPC gateway using SSH:\nssh \u0026lt;NetID\u0026gt;@gw.hpc.nyu.edu 2. SSH Connect to the HPC cluster using SSH:\nssh \u0026lt;NetID\u0026gt;@greene.hpc.nyu.edu 3. Save password (Optional) Once you logged in to HPC, you can set up an SSH key to avoid typing your password every time you log in.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Only do this on your trusted computer.\nFirst, generate a SSH key pair on your local machine (disconnecting from HPC):\nssh-keygen -t rsa Then, copy the public key to the HPC cluster:\nssh-copy-id \u0026lt;NetID\u0026gt;@greene.hpc.nyu.edu Now you can log in to HPC without typing your password.\nüìù Editor This section is optional but highly recommended. You can use any editor you like to edit scripts on HPC, here I recommend using VS Code.\n1. Install Download and install VS Code from here.\n2. Install Remote - SSH extension After open VS Code, search for SSH in the extension market and install Remote - SSH. Remote - SSH extension 3. Connect to HPC Click the button in the bottom left corner of VS Code and select Connect to Host.... Then, follow the instructions to connect to HPC.\nConclusion Now you should be able to access the HPC cluster and edit scripts on it.\n","date":1690502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690502400,"objectID":"596e8b48216be4b84b64c51f4a8d5a4c","permalink":"https://gaaaavin.github.io/The-Best-Practices/hpc/access_to_hpc/","publishdate":"2023-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/The-Best-Practices/hpc/access_to_hpc/","section":"hpc","summary":"HPC-part-1\n","tags":null,"title":"Accessing HPC","type":"hpc"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Again, this is NOT a blog about tutorials.\n‚ùì Why As a researcher who has been involved in various projects and experiments, I have come across numerous instances of incorrect practices being used with common research tools. This incorrect usage has led to flawed results and wasted time.\nI must admit that I too have made some mistakes along the way. However, through my journey, I have learned valuable lessons that have greatly improved my understanding of these tools and their proper usage.\nI am eager to share my experiences, insights, and best practices, as if I hoped that there were someone did the same for me when I was a beginner.\n‚ö†Ô∏è The Importance I don‚Äôt think I need to emphasize the importance of best practices in research.\nMoreover, inappropriate practices can affect other users becuase they often lead to abuse of shared resources. In the end, it makes the workflow inefficient for everyone.\nAs researchers, we strive to make meaningful contributions to our domains. Employing the right practices with research tools plays a pivotal role in achieving that goal.\nüèóÔ∏è Bridging the Gap As a newcomer to the world of research tools, I often found it challenging to locate comprehensive, easy-to-understand resources. Existing documentation can be dense, technical, and difficult to grasp, especially for beginners.\nMy aim in running this blog is to bridge that knowledge gap and provide fellow researchers, particularly newcomers, with practical insights and tips to effectively utilize these tools. I want to make the learning curve less steep for others than it was for me.\nüåü Like or contribute If you find this blog useful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub.\n","date":1690070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690070400,"objectID":"70a9df5c91f95d16682cd81b636b9fd1","permalink":"https://gaaaavin.github.io/The-Best-Practices/general/motivation/","publishdate":"2023-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/The-Best-Practices/general/motivation/","section":"general","summary":"Again, this is NOT a blog about tutorials.\n","tags":null,"title":"My Motivation for This Blog","type":"general"}]

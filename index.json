This incorrect usage has led to flawed results and wasted time.\nI must admit that I too have made some mistakes along the way. However, through my journey, I have learned valuable lessons that have greatly improved my understanding of these tools and their proper usage.\nI am eager to share my experiences, insights, and best practices, as if I hoped that there were someone did the same for me when I was a beginner.\n‚ö†Ô∏è The Importance I don‚Äôt think I need to emphasize the importance of best practices in research.\nMoreover, inappropriate practices can affect other users becuase they often lead to abuse of shared resources. In the end, it makes the workflow inefficient for everyone.\nAs researchers, we strive to make meaningful contributions to our domains. Employing the right practices with research tools plays a pivotal role in achieving that goal.\nüèóÔ∏è Bridging the Gap As a newcomer to the world of research tools, I often found it challenging to locate comprehensive, easy-to-understand resources. Existing documentation can be dense, technical, and difficult to grasp, especially for beginners.\nMy aim in running this blog is to bridge that knowledge gap and provide fellow researchers, particularly newcomers, with practical insights and tips to effectively utilize these tools. I want to make the learning curve less steep for others than it was for me.\nüåü Like or contribute If you find this blog useful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub.\n","date":1690070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690070400,"objectID":"70a9df5c91f95d16682cd81b636b9fd1","permalink":"https://gaaaavin.github.io/The-Best-Practices/general/motivation/","publishdate":"2023-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/The-Best-Practices/general/motivation/","section":"general","summary":"Again, this is NOT a blog about tutorials.\n","tags":null,"title":"My Motivation for This Blog","type":"general"}]
